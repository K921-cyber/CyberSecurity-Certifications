## üìñ About This Portfolio

This repository showcases my commitment to building **defensive security skills** through formal certifications, hands-on virtual internships, and practical training.

My core focus is on **Security Operations Center (SOC) workflows**, specializing in **threat detection, incident response, and proactive defense** against modern cyber threats.

---

## üí° Key Project Focus: SIEM & Analysis

While I've covered many areas, my most applied experience involves **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)**.

- **Splunk:** Developed custom search queries, created dynamic dashboards, and analyzed system logs to identify suspicious activity, reflecting SOC Tier 1/2 tasks.
- **Microsoft Sentinel:** Practiced ingesting data, configuring analytics rules, and managing incidents within a cloud-native security environment.
- **Threat Hunting:** Used both SIEM tools and Linux command-line utilities to proactively search for indicators of compromise (IOCs) and evasive threats.
